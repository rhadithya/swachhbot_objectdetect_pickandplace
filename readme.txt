SWACHH BOT- AN AUTONOMOUS OBJECT DETECTION AND PICK AND PLACE ROBOT CUSTOMISABLE FOR CLEANING TASKS
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The project involves development and implementation of a solution for an object detection and pick and place robot where in the robot has minimal computational power. This helps in developing cheaper swarm robotics solutions where in all computationally intensive operations can be performed on a centralised high performance computer/cloud and simple control operations are performed in robots. The robot is kept very modular with respect to the components used to make the overall cost cheaper. 

In our implementation, the video is captured by the mobile placed in the robot and is streamed to the computer. The computer performs all the computationally intensive tasks such as object detection, error estimation and sends the control instructions to the robot. The robot has NodeMCU(Arduino + WiFi module) that gets the control instructions from the computer and operates accordingly. The communication between the computer and NodeMCU is through WiFi via MQTT.
